From our platform, you can standardize your delivery across any architecture design, framework, or programming language, and easily enforce common compliance standards across them all. It's flexible enough to experiment with new features quickly on true staging environments, and promote them to production with a git merge. 

With a common platform and single API in place for packaging, provisioning, and deploying applications, it's then possible to focus DevOps work on optimizing those apps. Whether that be application performance, or coordinating all of your operations, all for the purpose of minimizing the environmental impact of your organization's work.
